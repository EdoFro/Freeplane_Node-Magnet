# Freeplane_Node-Magnet

in few words:

* groovy scripts to mark a node as magnet and then move selected nodes to it

---

## Description

Node-Magnet is a little AddOn for Freeplane MindMapping application. It adds commands to the node pop menu to easily move several nodes to another one. This can be useful for big maps where the nodes to be moved are far away from each other or from the destiny node.

## Download and Install

To install this AddOn you have to download the file "nodeMagnet-vX.X.X.addon.mm" from the [nodeMagnet folder](nodeMagnet/) to your computer, open it with Freeplane and follow the displayed instructions.

to download the file you can download or clone the whole project, or execute the following command from the command prompt in your computer (this works in Windows 10, but I think cURL is in other OS too):

`curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EdoFro/Freeplane_Node-Magnet/master/nodeMagnet/nodeMagnet-v0.0.1.addon.mm`

and the file will download to the active directory.

## Node pop up menu

After installing the AddOn yu have to restart Freeplane to get the new commands in the node menu.

When clicking with the right button of the mouse on a node it displays a pop up menu. At the bottom of it the new commands will appear (look at the image).
