# Freeplane_Node-Magnet

in few words:

* groovy scripts to mark a node as magnet and then move selected nodes to it

---

## Description

Node-Magnet is a little AddOn for Freeplane MindMapping application. It adds commands to the node pop menu to easily move several nodes to another one. This can be useful for big maps where the nodes to be moved are far away from each other or from the destiny node.
